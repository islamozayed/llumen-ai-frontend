# Llumen AI Frontend

Design prototype for the core **Llumen AI** experience: an executive landing surface plus a floating AI assistant that streams answers, maps, KPIs, slides, and data profiles in a dark, frosted UI shell.

> **Live demo:** [islamozayed.github.io/llumen-ai-frontend](https://islamozayed.github.io/llumen-ai-frontend/)

This repository is a **frontend-only demo**. Conversation flows, maps, and panels are driven by local demo data — there is no production backend wired up yet.

---

## What’s in the demo

### Landing home
- Greeting and **attention carousel** with map / chart / AI cards
- Workspace and category filter pills
- Sticky frosted header (logo, search, Studio / Create actions)
- **Recommended for you** story cards
- Mesh-gradient page backdrop (Paper shaders), capped for GPU cost

### Floating AI assistant
- Launcher FAB that expands into a docked or fullscreen panel
- Chat composer with modes, attachments affordances, and send / stop states
- Streaming-style **timeline replies** (thinking steps → summary → follow-ups)
- **Inline visuals**: Mapbox map, KPI widgets, report thumbnails, image cards
- **@ mentions** / inline context menu for attaching sources mid-compose
- **Sessions** sidebar (open / share / new conversation)
- In-chat **search** with match count and prev / next navigation
- **Sources** panel and data-source settings
- Component detail views: map bleed header, slides, data profiles, visualization settings
- Share modal and AI-generated asset badges

The entry point is intentionally thin: `App` renders `CompactAssistantDemo`, which owns the landing layer, mesh background, and assistant lifecycle.

## Getting started

### Requirements
- **Node.js 22+** (matches CI)
- npm (comes with Node)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173/llumen-ai-frontend/`).  
The Vite `base` is set to `/llumen-ai-frontend/` for GitHub Pages, so the app is served under that path locally as well.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

- `build` runs `tsc -b` then `vite build` and writes to `dist/`
- `preview` serves the production bundle locally

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Configuration notes

### Vite base path
GitHub project Pages hosts the site at:

`https://islamozayed.github.io/llumen-ai-frontend/`

`vite.config.ts` sets:

```ts
base: '/llumen-ai-frontend/'
```

Asset helpers under `src/llumen-assistant` already use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so public assets resolve correctly under that subpath.

### CSS minify / backdrop blur
Vite 8 defaults CSS minify to Lightning CSS, which can drop unprefixed `backdrop-filter` when a `-webkit-` fallback is also present. Chromium then loses frosted-glass surfaces in production.

This project forces:

```ts
build: {
  cssMinify: 'esbuild',
}
```

Keep that setting (or an equivalent fix) if you change the build toolchain.

### Mapbox
`InteractiveMap` uses a Mapbox style and public token embedded for the demo. Rotate or move credentials to environment variables before any non-demo deployment.

---

## Design system

Visual language comes from:

- `component-library/llumen-design-system.css` — reference tokens and patterns
- `src/styles/tokens.css` — app-facing CSS variables (`--lc-*`, spacing, radii, materials)
- Per-component CSS Modules under `src/llumen-assistant/**`

The app is **dark-theme only**. Surfaces use translucent fills plus `backdrop-filter` for frosted materials. Prefer design tokens over hard-coded colors when extending UI.

Typography:
- **UI:** Innovator Grotesk (self-hosted in `fonts/`)
- **Mono / data:** IBM Plex Mono (loaded from Google Fonts in `index.html`)

---

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger [.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml):

1. Checkout
2. Node 22 + `npm ci`
3. `npm run build`
4. Upload `dist/` as a Pages artifact
5. Deploy with `actions/deploy-pages`

You can also re-run the workflow manually (**Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**).

**Pages settings required**
- Source: **GitHub Actions** (not “Deploy from a branch”)
- That way Pages serves the Vite production build, not the raw repo `index.html`

---

## Demo data & limitations

- Replies, sources, sessions, AQI maps, and data profiles are **scripted demos** in TypeScript modules (for example `airQualityConversationDemo.ts`, `componentDataProfiles.ts`).
- There is no auth, persistence, or live LLM/API integration in this repo.
- Treat Mapbox tokens and any future secrets as temporary demo credentials.
